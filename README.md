Computational Physics; First Hydrodynamics Code

Solved Euler equation in two different situations:

1) Reimann problem; Shock tube. Two different pressure/density states places next to each other and allowed to evolve

2) Propogating wave. I used a Gaussian pulse travelling right.

In both cases, we see formation of shock. Pretty cool.
